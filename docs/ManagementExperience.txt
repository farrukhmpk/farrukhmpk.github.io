Overall I have a collaborative management style in the sense that I coordinate with stake holders, scrum masters/project managers and the delivery team to identify, prioritize and assign tasks to appropriate development resources. I encourage the developers to take responsibility for the tasks instead of assigning tasks, but I assign tasks when they are unclaimed and impeding delivery of the business value and work stream. Generally before making a decision, I weigh all pros and cons and encourage a healthy debate among the team.

Some of the targeted answers below as per your request. Hope they help.
